# high_school_game_design

I took a class in high school on game design. It was anticlimactic after learning Java because it was drag and drop. 

Even though I didn't specifically learn to code video games, I did learn some skills on how to make games.

To view/play, make sure to download the entire folder for the game and go to http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker to download the program. It's free. If you need help with playing the game, my email is on my profile.

**Happy playing, fellow gamers.**
